MANUAL FOR KEYBOARD FIRMWARE DEVELOPMENT AND FLASHING

The firmware is based on QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard)

#1 How to flash the compiled file onto the KB-MCU (RP2040):
	* Precompiled file: helios_kb_rev1_default_20240326.uf2
	* Recompiled (and changed) see: #2
1. Connect pin 7 of J_IN1 to GND
2. Connect the keyboard with your computer over USB (ie. solder the ends of an USB cable to J_IN1, an USB-drive should appear in the hardware drive list)
3. Drag and drop the .uf2 into the USB-drive
4. Disconnect pin 7 of J_IN1 to GND
5. Repower the keyboard (i.e. disconnect the USB connection)
6. Connected over USB the keyboard will appear as a USB device and will provide input to the computer if buttons are being pressed.
7. Enjoy using the hardware!

#2 How to compile the keyboard project:

Info: The project was developed and tested under Windows 11.

1. Download and install the QMK-Firmware (external links)
	* Worked on version: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_distro_msys/releases/tag/1.7.2,
    * Newest version (untested) https://github.com/qmk/qmk_distro_msys/releases/latest

2. Follow these steps https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started
3. Create a new project with the steps from https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware?id=create-a-new-keymap
	* Name the keyboard project: helios_kb_rev1
	* Copy the contents of helios_kb_rev1_20240326.zip into the project folder and replace existing files
4. To apply underlaying changes outside the project folder replace the folders quantum and platforms from the quantum.zip and platforms.zip

5. Edit the the files in the project folder (For detailed information see the official QMK docs)

6. Compile the project with QMK MSYS and the following command: "qmk compile -kb helios_kb_rev1 -km default"

7. To flash the compiled file see #1

#3 Keyboard-bindings for lighting up the LEDS (Assuming full component placement regarding the keyboard-BOM):
(Flash the provided .uf2 file onto the MCU first under #1)
* F2: Toggle W-LEDs
* F3: Increase WLED intensity
* F4: Decrease WLED intensity
* F6: Toggle RGB-LEDs
* F7: Increase RGB-LED value intensity (HS V)
* F8: Decrease RGB-LED value intensity (HS V)
* F9: Increase RGB-LED saturation intensity (H S V)
* F10: Decrease RGB-LED hue intensity (H S V)
* F11: Increase RGB-LED saturation intensity (H SV)
* F12: Decrease RGB-LED saturation intensity (H SV)
